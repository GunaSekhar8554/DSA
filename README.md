# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

### This repostiory is soley made for my interview purpose and its doesn't contain any basic explanations



### Everything that I mentioned in repositiories are
    
    1. Time Complexity finding methods for various datastructures and 
       algorithms from the referenced book
    2. Github Repositories I followed to implement every algorithm 
    3. Github Repositories I followed to learn Python Programming 
    4. Websites I used to practise the coding Problems 
    5. Articles to increase the efficiency the problem
